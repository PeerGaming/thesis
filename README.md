PeerGaming - Thesis
===================

The official bachelor thesis about PeerGaming.

Its original title is: _Creating a Client-Side Multiplayer Gaming Framework for the Web,
which handles Distributed Logic on Multiple Systems in "Real-Time"._

There is no excuse for the quality, but this was my first attempt to write a scientifc paper.
During the iterations of the creation I realised that reasearch doesn't suit me -
I am more an engineer and coder who prefers to implement usable tools as a result.
